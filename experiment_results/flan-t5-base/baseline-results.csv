small amounts of regular ice appear to be white because of air bubbles inside them and also because small quantities of water appear to be colourless. in glaciers, the pressure causes the air bubbles to be squeezed out, increasing the density of the created ice. large quantities of water appear to be blue, as it absorbs other colours more efficiently than blue. a large piece of compressed ice, or a glacier, similarly appears blue.

at high altitude, atmospheric pressure is lower than that at sea level. this is due to two competing physical effects: gravity, which causes the air to be as close as possible to the ground; and the heat content of the air, which causes the molecules to bounce off each other and expand.[8]
